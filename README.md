# devops-assignment-ap

Hi Pawel,

I have tried the assignment that you have assigned to me.
I have tried in local, VMware ubuntu and AWS EC2 instances.

After creating Jenkins image, I have logged into Jenkins and installed required plugins.
Created the new pipeline job and started executing it.
I am facing the build failure issues because of some errors at the code level.

I am facing the Build failure issue in all envs that I have tried in.
Containers are deleting once the system is shutdown/restart.
So, I have installed Jenkins everytime I login to ubuntu server.

Please find the attachment image for error info that I have got multiple times.
Pipeline is taking more than 1hr 30mins each time it builds and it immediately unresponsive after that.
Somehow I was able to take one error details image.

I have written the Jenkinsfile for all stages that you have assigned. Please refer the Jenkinsfile.
